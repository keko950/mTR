Synthetic long reads generated using Badread for simulating PacBio and Nanopore reads (Wick, 2019)

<File name> = <unit length>_<frequency>_pacbio|nanopore.fasta.zip

<unit length> = 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200.
<frequency>   = 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200.

For example, file name "100_200_pacbio.fasta.zip" 
has 1000 PacBio reads each read of which has 200 occurrences of a 100bp unit.
