Synthetic long reads generated using Badread for simulating PacBio and Nanopore reads (Wick, 2019)

<Fasta file name> = <unit length>_<frequency>_pacbio|nanopore.fasta

<unit length> = 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200.
<frequency>   = 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200.

For example, fasta file name "100_200_pacbio.fasta" has 1000 PacBio reads each read of which has 200 occurrences of a 100bp unit.

Because the size of each file needs to be smaller than 25MB, we divided 200_200_pacbio.fasta into 
200_200_pacbio_1.fasta and 200_200_pacbio_2.fasta, each of which contains 500 PacBio reads with 200 occurrences of a 200bp unit.
Similarly, we divided 200_200_nanopore.fasta into two.

To obtain these fasta files, you need to unzip all zip files.
